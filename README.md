<h1>How to play</h1>
<p>This guide will explain how to play<br>
 wine simulator beta 2.0</p>
 <h2>Berries</h2>
 <p>Berries can be gained by berry bushes. Berry bushes<br>
 will give you a berry every 63 seconds. A berry bush can be bought at <br>
 the merchant's market</p>
 <h2>Wine and kegs</h2>
 <p>A keg is another item that can be bought at the mechant's market.<br>
 Once you have a berry you can click a keg and wait 90 seconds to<br>
 and the keg will produce wine if clicked.<br>
 The wine can then be sold by pressing one.</p>
 <h2>Joja Cola</h2>
 <p>(Stolen from stardew valley) A soda machine can be bought again at the mechant.<br>
 Once you have a wine you can click the machine and wait 100 to make a joja cola.<br>
 You can sell it by pressing 2.</p>
 <h2>Cellars</h2>
 <p>Once you have gotten all 8 kegs you can click the cellar button.<br>
 Once you do this you will have gotten a cellar and your kegs reset to one.<br>
 A cellar is 8 kegs put together. Which means it will take 8 berries but you will<br>
 only have to wait 110 seconds to make 8 wine.</p>
